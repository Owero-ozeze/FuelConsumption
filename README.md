# FuelConsumption

Considering the changes in global warming, estimations of fuel consumption and emission are essential in evaluating how materials will affect the environment. In this study, 5539 records containing vehicles observed from the 2010-2014 dataset of the Canadian government were used to perform an exploratory data analysis and prediction, presenting a comparison of several vehicle manufacturers and models based on their fuel efficiency and C02 emissions. According to the results from the analysis of data, this research provides makers and users of vehicles with substantial suggestions for lowering environmental pollution. Furthermore, Linear Regression, AdaBoost regressor, and gradient boosting regression models were used to predict C02 emissions. The research showed that the gradient boosting regression model was the best model when compared to others, with an accuracy of 91% while AdaBoost regressor and linear regression had 90% and 85% respectively.
